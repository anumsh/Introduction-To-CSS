	<p>computer is a magic box full of pixies and computer games that can do simple things like milking a cat, mathematical operations (not real ones though), telling strangers about your life and composing essays. It has been likened unto a potent sled dog that sucks the user into habitual addictive behaviors. Once the user is exposed to teh Internets and its wealth of hallucinogenic properties, the user is converted into an insomniac, craving more hallucinations to sate their addiction. Addicts can be identified from restlessness when not in contact with a computer, compulsive urge to turn on the computer once they are conscious, excessive bleeding, and basking in the warm glow of the monitor at the hour of 6 in the morning, bleary eyed and still engaging in acts such as Counter Strike, Starcraft, Tribes (any version), World of Warcraft, Everquest, Uncyclopedia, cybering and the like, despite obvious signs of fatigue. Computers are also known as Conan O'Brian's private boxing opponents. He can kick, hit, punch, crash, destroy, eat, throw, drop, push, pull, punish, hurt and cut Conan. Every game are ties.</p>
